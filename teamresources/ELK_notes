Installation
	Elasticsearch
		Requires JDK 6 or later
		Currently testing "Sense" plugin for Chrome as a GUI
		Program freezing on ./elasticsearch -f
		Run via ./elasticsearch -d instead
		PUT
			creating data
		POST
			for searching
			can use "query" command
			e.g.:
			POST /_search
				{
    				"query": {
        				"query_string": {
            				"query": "ford",
            				"fields": ["director"]
        				}
    				}
				}
			Can also filter these query results using "filter"
		Was having issues trying to get a GUI running because of the "localhost" issue
			Potentially resolved by Will's suggestion of specifying the ec2's IP or by using 0.0.0.0:9200 (default port is 9200 for http)
		Try private IP address in place of localhost
	Logstash
		Enabled some local testing which pushed logged lines as JSON objects to my locally running version of elasticsearch
		Have not begun testing on EC2 servers yet
